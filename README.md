# Student Management Program

## Overview

This Python project manages student data, allowing users to store student details, add subject marks, and calculate the total marks and percentage. The class-based implementation uses methods to handle student information and subject-specific marks.

## Features

- **Add Student Details**: Stores the student's name, roll number, and class.
- **Add Marks**: Allows users to add marks for different subjects.
- **Total Marks Calculation**: Automatically calculates the total marks and average marks of the student.
- **Display Details**: Shows the studentâ€™s name, roll number, class, total marks, and percentage.

## How It Works

1. **Initialize a Student**: Create a student object by providing the student's name, roll number, and class.
2. **Add Marks**: Add marks for subjects. If the subject already exists, the program will notify the user.
3. **Calculate and Display**: The program calculates total marks and percentage, and displays the student's details.
